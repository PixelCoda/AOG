WIP!!! Do not use!!

I highly recommend using the python version for now. It's messy but it works. 

The Rust version will have a smaller memory footprint, better memory safety, and more features in the long term. 

The hardware will always remain the same or similar. v2 will be reverse compatible with v1 A.O.G. builds.
