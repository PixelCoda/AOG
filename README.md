# A.O.G. (Algae Oxygen Reactor)

CO2 is a dangerous indoor/outdoor air pollutant. A.O.G. (Algae Oxygen Reactor) uses blue-green algae to convert CO2 into Oxygen.

When I first activated A.O.G....my average indoor CO2 levels were 1000-2000ppm+.  After 6+ months of use my indoor CO2 level averages between 400-600ppm. 

I decided to license this project under the MIT license so that individuals and corporations can make/modify/sell A.O.G without restrictions. Speed is essential in controlling climate change. The more units built...the better.

Source code, build pictures, and videos can be found at the Github link below. Hardware schematics and build instructions coming soon :)
