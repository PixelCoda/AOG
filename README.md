# A.O.G. (Algae Oxygen Reactor)

CO2 is the largest indoor pollutant. A.O.G. uses blue-green algae to convert CO2 into O2.

When I first activated A.O.G....my average indoor CO2 levels were 1000-2000ppm+.  After 6+ months of use my indoor CO2 level averages between 400-600ppm. 

I decided to license this project under the MIT license so that individuals and corporations can make/modify/sell A.O.G without restrictions. I want to give people the power to offset their own CO2 emissions at home.

Hardware schematics and build instructions cooming soon :) Examples of my A.O.G. build can be found in the media folder.
