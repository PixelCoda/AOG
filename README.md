# A.O.G. (Algae Oxygen Reactor)

CO2 is a dangerous indoor/outdoor air pollutant. A.O.G. uses blue-green algae to convert CO2 into Oxygen.

When I first activated the A.O.G....my average indoor CO2 levels were 1000-2000ppm+.  
After 6+ months of use my indoor CO2 level averages between 400-600ppm. 

This project is licensed under the MIT license so that individuals and corporations can make/modify/sell A.O.G. without any restrictions. 

Prototype MK1 build pictures and videos can be found in the media folder. 

A parts list and build instructions can be found in the BUILD.md file.
